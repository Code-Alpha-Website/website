                        <p>
                            <b>Background</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>The social sector has been visibly slow on leveraging technology and the reasons for this are
                            no secret – lack of adequate investments, limited capacity to implement change, inadequate
                            training on technology use, weak post implementation technology support & service, rigid
                            mindsets and more. While the challenges in the sector are large, fascinating and seemingly
                            frightening, philanthropic push manages to attract only a handful of passionate individuals
                            and even fewer numbers of individuals with technical strengths. The spread of technology
                            and its use has been in pockets and often dependent on external benefactors. However,
                            technologies maturing in the areas of internet, telephony, satellites, voice and image
                            recognition, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, analytics,
                            point-of-use
                            IoT devices etc. present an opportunity for societal platforms that can enable point
                            solutions
                            at a scale and affordability that was not possible earlier. </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Approach</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>Social Alpha intends to build and evangelize usable, affordable and quality software to fill
                            urgent and immediate gaps in the sector. Philanthropic investment in software needs to
                            meet additional goals to create and strengthen societal platforms while providing
                            recognizable value to consumers. Open source technologies and tools is now popularly
                            accepted and help reduce the cost of developing new software by leveraging existing
                            software to create something new and unique, helps drive high-performance modular
                            architecture while the openness enables trust and inclusiveness. Software that is based on a
                            product/platform approach using open standards for interoperability ensures that future
                            consumers do not spend sparse resources duplicating existing software solutions and in
                            expensive integration efforts. Open Source allows new consumers the freedom to run the
                            software, study and modify the software, redistribute the software and distribute
                            modifications to the software. Open sourcing software ensures higher trust, adoption, faster
                            improvements, lower maintenance, expert scrutiny.</p>
                        <p>Social Alpha is committed to build societal software products/platforms using open source
                            software. The products/platforms we create will also be open source software and this is our
                            commitment of giving back to both the open source community and the social sector. Open
                            source licenses are many, with licenses classified as Permissive, Weak Copyleft and Copyleft
                            types. Building on top of open source provides a rich source of base software components
                            with Permissive, Weak Copyleft and Copyleft type of licenses – this makes the software we
                            build aka the derivative, to naturally and easily fit under the Copyleft type license. Both
                            Permissive and Weak Copyleft type licenses allow for derivatives to be licensed as Copyleft
                            type. Copyleft type licenses also prevent uncooperative developers from converting open
                            source software into proprietary software while ensuring that modified/extended versions
                            remain free for unrestricted public use, future modification and distribution. Copyleft type
                            license is expected to help the body of work grow over time as usage increases while
                            community contributions help improve and strengthen the solution further. Creating new
                            software under the Copyleft type license maximizes the benefits to the social sector through
                            initial lower costs as it builds on top of a large base of open source software and ensures
                            visibility of improvements to its derivatives, thus making Copyleft type license the primary
                            license choice for our societal platforms.
                        </p>

                        <p>The need for affordable software-based solutions drives our efforts to maintain a corpus of
                            relevant software solutions - components, products and platforms relevant in our sector.
                            There may exist popular affordable open source components that partly or fully match the
                            needs in the sector- these make it to the corpus of component collection for immediate and
                            future use. For a need where no open source solutions exist, we create new open source
                            components that are designed for affordability, accessibility and usability and these are
                            built
                            using existing and stable open source software – once created these too make it to the
                            corpus of component collection. The component collection is a virtual repository of curated,
                            useful open source software solutions – it aims to encourage usage (implement),
                            modification, distribution of components/products/platforms and hence reduce duplication
                            of efforts and resource spends in the social sector. Advancements in technology overtime
                            will call for retiring older and less efficient components in the collection. This corpus of
                            component collection is expected to continuously change based on finding new solutions
                            from scouting exercises, creation of new open source components and retiring of older less
                            useful components as part of housekeeping exercises.

                            For a software solution need expressed or identified in the social sector, Social Alpha’s
                            first
                            response will be to either recommend solutions prevalent within the social sector or
                            recommend a solution within the identified corpus of components/products/platforms or
                            scout for existing affordable, usable solutions in the larger software solutions space. We
                            look
                            to build only when the need is generic (multiple identified and/or potential users) and the
                            market lacks an affordable, usable solution. We build for the ecosystem and hence we prefer
                            to open source our work and encourage all ecosystem players to do the same. While leading
                            edge technology is exciting, we prefer to base our work on modern, well understood and
                            stable technology. The software we build needs to be stable, easily available, easy to use
                            and
                            operationally sustainable. This drives the need for a high degree of engineering automation,
                            inter-operability, component-based design and building on top of popular open source
                            technologies and build as a multi-tenanted solution wherever possible. Usability of the
                            software is one key consideration for the solutions we build, and it drives our focus on the
                            value that every user perceives, effective design of the UI, flexibility achieved through
                            simple
                            configurations and ease of deployment and upgrades.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ideally platforms solving large scale problems will be able to demonstrate a growing user
                            base and have multiple impact stories to tell. A large active user community, supported by a
                            strong open source community of software developers and solution implementers is vital for
                            a successful platform. While new platforms will initially be funded through philanthropic
                            capital, it is key to understand and look for viable operational sustainability of the
                            platform.
                            Revenue models that allow for simplified and affordable use of the solution while covering
                            operational costs and feature enhancement costs need to be considered. Subscription based
                            access, implementation services, multi-tenancy, single stable code base, interoperability,
                            open standards, component based, micro services, flexible infrastructure scaling will be
                            some
                            of the key tenets to ensure sustainable and affordable platforms.

                            Typical concerns around open source software are around support, security and data privacy.
                            - Social Alpha will commit to support the new societal platforms that we create until such
                            time there exist visible value to the user community.
                            - While closed source software approaches security through obscurity, open source relies
                            on transparency - nothing makes one intrinsically more secure than the other. The most
                            active open source projects benefit from a large community that detects and responds to
                            issues rapidly. The good news is that there are online databases and tools that track
                            vulnerabilities in open source libraries.
                            - Open Source software provides more control over data with the ability to adapt the open
                            source software to comply with specific data privacy policies as well as the ability to
                            easily
                            audit/inspect the manipulation of data by the software.

                        <p>
                            Social Alpha is committed to the open source solutions it builds by ensuring the following:
                            • provide access to source code and documentation that enables contributions, public
                            use, modification and distribution of the solution.
                            • select and implement open source engineering tools for Source Control Management,
                            Static Code Analysis, Configuration Management, Continuous Integration and
                            Deployment, Container Management, Test Automation, Monitoring & Log Analytics,
                            etc.
                            • create and maintain staging environments for solutions – dev, QA, Production, and a
                            demo environment if required.
                            • assign named owners to key roles like product owners, SMEs, lead
                            developers/gatekeepers, DevOps manager, community manager etc.
                            • periodic and need based security checks and updates.

                        <p>
                        For Social Alpha, creating open source societal platforms is a natural choice as it
                            encourages
                            transparency, trust, longevity, collaboration, co-creation, diversity while ensuring
                            stability,
                            scale and sustainability. We are completely committed to building these societal platforms
                            and we invite like-minded people to join us in solving societal problems through open source
                            software development.
