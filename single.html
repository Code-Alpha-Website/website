								<h1 class="entry-title">Open Source Societal Platforms | Concept Note</h1>
							</header>
							<div class="entry-content clearfix">
								<p>The social sector has been visibly slow on leveraging technology and the reasons for this are
									no secret – lack of adequate investments, limited capacity to implement change, inadequate
									training on technology use, weak post implementation technology support & service, rigid
									mindsets and more. While the challenges in the sector are large, fascinating and seemingly
									frightening, philanthropic push manages to attract only a handful of passionate individuals
									and even fewer numbers of individuals with technical strengths. The spread of technology
									and its use has been in pockets and often dependent on external benefactors. However,
									technologies maturing in the areas of internet, telephony, satellites, voice and image
									recognition, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, analytics, point-of-use
									IoT devices etc. present an opportunity for societal platforms that can enable point solutions
									at a scale and affordability that was not possible earlier. </p>
								<p>Social Alpha intends to build and evangelize usable, affordable and quality software to fill
									urgent and immediate gaps in the sector. Philanthropic investment in software needs to
									meet additional goals to create and strengthen societal platforms while providing
									recognizable value to consumers. Open source technologies and tools is now popularly
									accepted and help reduce the cost of developing new software by leveraging existing
									software to create something new and unique, helps drive high-performance modular
									architecture while the openness enables trust and inclusiveness. Software that is based on a
									product/platform approach using open standards for interoperability ensures that future
									consumers do not spend sparse resources duplicating existing software solutions and in
									expensive integration efforts. Open Source allows new consumers the freedom to run the
									software, study and modify the software, redistribute the software and distribute
									modifications to the software. Open sourcing software ensures higher trust, adoption, faster
									improvements, lower maintenance, expert scrutiny.</p>
								<p>Social Alpha is committed to build societal software products/platforms using open source
									software. The products/platforms we create will also be open source software and this is our
									commitment of giving back to both the open source community and the social sector. Open
									source licenses are many, with licenses classified as Permissive, Weak Copyleft and Copyleft
									types. Building on top of open source provides a rich source of base software components
									with Permissive, Weak Copyleft and Copyleft type of licenses – this makes the software we
									build aka the derivative, to naturally and easily fit under the Copyleft type license. Both
									Permissive and Weak Copyleft type licenses allow for derivatives to be licensed as Copyleft
									type. Copyleft type licenses also prevent uncooperative developers from converting open
									source software into proprietary software while ensuring that modified/extended versions
									remain free for unrestricted public use, future modification and distribution. Copyleft type
									license is expected to help the body of work grow over time as usage increases while
									community contributions help improve and strengthen the solution further. Creating new
									software under the Copyleft type license maximizes the benefits to the social sector through
									initial lower costs as it builds on top of a large base of open source software and ensures
									visibility of improvements to its derivatives, thus making Copyleft type license the primary
									license choice for our societal platforms.
								</p>

								<p>The need for affordable software-based solutions drives our efforts to maintain a corpus of
									relevant software solutions - components, products and platforms relevant in our sector.
									There may exist popular affordable open source components that partly or fully match the
									needs in the sector- these make it to the corpus of component collection for immediate and
									future use. For a need where no open source solutions exist, we create new open source
									components that are designed for affordability, accessibility and usability and these are built
									using existing and stable open source software – once created these too make it to the
									corpus of component collection. The component collection is a virtual repository of curated,
									useful open source software solutions – it aims to encourage usage (implement),
									modification, distribution of components/products/platforms and hence reduce duplication
									of efforts and resource spends in the social sector. Advancements in technology overtime
									will call for retiring older and less efficient components in the collection. This corpus of
									component collection is expected to continuously change based on finding new solutions
									from scouting exercises, creation of new open source components and retiring of older less
									useful components as part of housekeeping exercises.
								</p>
								<p>
									For a software solution need expressed or identified in the social sector, Social Alpha’s first
									response will be to either recommend solutions prevalent within the social sector or
									recommend a solution within the identified corpus of components/products/platforms or
									scout for existing affordable, usable solutions in the larger software solutions space. We look
									to build only when the need is generic (multiple identified and/or potential users) and the
									market lacks an affordable, usable solution. We build for the ecosystem and hence we prefer
									to open source our work and encourage all ecosystem players to do the same. While leading
									edge technology is exciting, we prefer to base our work on modern, well understood and
									stable technology. The software we build needs to be stable, easily available, easy to use and
									operationally sustainable. This drives the need for a high degree of engineering automation,
									inter-operability, component-based design and building on top of popular open source
									technologies and build as a multi-tenanted solution wherever possible. Usability of the
									software is one key consideration for the solutions we build, and it drives our focus on the
									value that every user perceives, effective design of the UI, flexibility achieved through simple
									configurations and ease of deployment and upgrades.
								</p>
								<p>
									Ideally platforms solving large scale problems will be able to demonstrate a growing user
									base and have multiple impact stories to tell. A large active user community, supported by a
									strong open source community of software developers and solution implementers is vital for
									a successful platform. While new platforms will initially be funded through philanthropic capital, it is key to understand and look for viable operational sustainability of the platform.
									Revenue models that allow for simplified and affordable use of the solution while covering
									operational costs and feature enhancement costs need to be considered. Subscription based
									access, implementation services, multi-tenancy, single stable code base, interoperability,
									open standards, component based, micro services, flexible infrastructure scaling will be some
									of the key tenets to ensure sustainable and affordable platforms.
								</p>

								<p>
									Typical concerns around open source software are around support, security and data privacy.
									- Social Alpha will commit to support the new societal platforms that we create until such
									time there exist visible value to the user community.
									- While closed source software approaches security through obscurity, open source relies
									on transparency - nothing makes one intrinsically more secure than the other. The most
									active open source projects benefit from a large community that detects and responds to
									issues rapidly. The good news is that there are online databases and tools that track
									vulnerabilities in open source libraries.
									- Open Source software provides more control over data with the ability to adapt the open
									source software to comply with specific data privacy policies as well as the ability to easily
									audit/inspect the manipulation of data by the software.
								</p>

								<p>
									Social Alpha is committed to the open source solutions it builds by ensuring the following:
									• provide access to source code and documentation that enables contributions, public
									use, modification and distribution of the solution.
									• select and implement open source engineering tools for Source Control Management,
									Static Code Analysis, Configuration Management, Continuous Integration and
									Deployment, Container Management, Test Automation, Monitoring & Log Analytics,
									etc.
									• create and maintain staging environments for solutions – dev, QA, Production, and a
									demo environment if required.
									• assign named owners to key roles like product owners, SMEs, lead
									developers/gatekeepers, DevOps manager, community manager etc.
									• periodic and need based security checks and updates.
								</p>
								<p>
									Conclusion
									For Social Alpha, creating open source societal platforms is a natural choice as it encourages
									transparency, trust, longevity, collaboration, co-creation, diversity while ensuring stability,
									scale and sustainability. We are completely committed to building these societal platforms
									and we invite like-minded people to join us in solving societal problems through open source
									software development.
